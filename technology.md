Some of the technologies we will use for this product are:

###### Unity 3D game engine
- This engine is perfect for our game as it runs on the .Net Framework and also incorporates the C# language.
- The game engine has alot of features built in that will help us realise our idea (game).
- This includes 3D object creation, terrain creation, visual effects, built  in animators etc.
- Most of these can be manipulated with drag and drop interaction.
- All of these objects can be controlled (programmed) using the C# Language in the forms of scripts that can be attached to the objects as a "component"
- All of the game Logic that will be implemented will be in the form of C# scripts aswell. Such as game objectives, game states etc.
- One of the best things about Unity is its cross platform support which is a crucial reason why we are also using it as our vision includes having this game work on both Android and IOS devices.

 ###### Facebook API
- We hope to intergrate the option for the user to log into thier prexsisting Facebook accounts.
- As we wont be requesting any information from the user other than their public profiles, email and friends list there are no issues with permissions for the application. 
- The login process with be a two-step verificaiton process either by mobile number or email.
